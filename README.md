Minecraft (a Python Module)
Joshua Mottaz

An extension module with the goal of providing a fast, intuitive way to interact with worlds outside of the game itself.  Some goals of the project include:

* Simplicity - writing scripts to modify a world should be easy.
* Tools - Besides simply being able to retrieve and place blocks, additional tools to do things like help generate primitives should be available.
* Free-standing - The worlds generated are intended to be consumed by Minecraft, but they shouldn't rely on any functionality provided by Minecraft.

The GitHub wiki is slowly being populated with documentation as well, so check it out for more information!
